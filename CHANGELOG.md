# Changelog

All notable changes to `rlm-notebook` are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/), and this project
adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

`rlm-notebook` is an RLM-driven research notebook, built on
[`rlm-kit`](https://github.com/qazbnm456/rlm-kit): paste in sources of any kind, ask grounded
questions with verifiable citations, and get a distilled research artifact out.

## [Unreleased]

- **First slice: ingestion (text/web/PDF with local hybrid OCR) + citation-grounded chat, driven
  from a CLI.** No session persistence, no API/UI, no Notebook Guide, no Audio Overview yet — see
  CLAUDE.md's Scope note. Everything below is what this slice actually contains, and the design
  calls that shaped it.

  **All sources become one blob, not a vector index.** `corpus.py` concatenates every ingested
  source into a single string tagged with `[[SRC:<id>|<locator>]]` markers and hands the whole thing
  to `AnswerQuestion` as one signature field — the model explores it in the sandboxed REPL
  (`.find()`/slicing) rather than through embedding similarity search. This is rlm-kit's native
  mechanic (an RLM signature field *is* a REPL variable), not a new indexing layer; a vector-search
  fallback for corpora too large for one blob is deferred until real usage shows the size cap
  (invariant 8) actually binds.

  **No fetch/network tool is reachable at question-answering time.** Early designs considered
  reusing `rlm_kit.tools.fetch.make_fetch_tool` as a live tool so the model could pull in more
  context on demand; adversarial review found this turns a prompt-injected source into a live data
  exfiltration path, since the SSRF guard only blocks internal targets, not legitimate-looking
  external ones. Ingestion-time fetching is host-side and one-shot instead — see invariant 1. A
  second, independent review then found that the ingestion-time fetch itself had a gap: the
  default `urllib` opener follows a redirect's `Location` header unconditionally, so an
  initially-safe URL could 302 to an internal/metadata target with no further check. Fixed with a
  redirect handler that re-validates every hop (invariant 2), verified against a real redirect
  target before landing.

  **Citation verification is coordinate-only, and says so.** `citations.py` confirms a `Citation`'s
  `source_id`/`locator` resolves to real corpus text; it does not attempt to verify the model's
  prose is faithful to that text, and no docstring or UI copy should imply otherwise (invariant 5).
  `AnswerQuestion` also validates its own draft against `Answer`'s schema in-REPL, before SUBMIT,
  via `rlm_kit.tools.validation.make_schema_validator` — chosen over a post-hoc whole-run retry
  because rlm-kit's own retry policy defaults to `max_retries=1` specifically because a full RLM
  re-run rarely fixes a persistent (rather than transient) coercion failure. Not yet verified
  against a real model, only an offline scripted one — see invariant 4's residual-risk note.

  **`injection_scan.py` flags, never blocks.** A deterministic heuristic scan runs at ingestion
  time; a flagged source's content still reaches the model and its answer still returns, with the
  flag surfaced as metadata alongside it (invariant 6) — this is a transparency mechanism, not a
  gate, matching the reward-free/judgement-only posture this whole family of rlm-kit consumers
  shares. Its rules favor recall over precision on purpose (invariant 6's note).

  **OCR ships enabled, not merely pluggable.** `parsers/pdf.py` uses `pymupdf4llm`'s built-in hybrid
  OCR (RapidOCR primary, Tesseract fallback) for scanned/image PDF pages, with the backends as core
  `dependencies` rather than an opt-in extra left uninstalled by default — an independent review
  caught an earlier draft doing exactly that (an `ocr` extra CI's plain `uv sync` never installed,
  reproduced with a real failing test against a clean sync), the same mistake a sibling open-source
  project shipped and had silently fail to parse image sources in its default Docker image; see
  invariant 7.

  **Execution model: still in-process for this slice.** An earlier design iterated on how to isolate
  each chat turn (a `serving.py`/`harness_serve.py`-based subprocess pool was proposed, then
  adversarial review found that mechanism is built for one-shot hierarchical task delegation, not
  high-frequency low-latency turns, and its `stdout` contract blocks any progress-event side
  channel). The simplification landed on was: one plain subprocess per turn, `start_new_session=True`
  for a reliable `killpg`-based cancel, no pre-warmed pool. That runner (`runner.py`/`worker.py`) is
  not implemented in this slice — `cli.py` calls `AnswerQuestion.run()` in-process — and lands with
  the API/UI slice that actually needs concurrent turns and cancellation.
